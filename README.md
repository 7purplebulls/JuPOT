# JuPOT

JuPOT is a package in Julia that leverages the power of `JuMP <https://github.com/JuliaOpt/JuMP.jl>`_ 
to design a simple and powerful tool for the set-up of portfolio optimization problems. The package 
gives power to create objects to contain the :ref:`Assets <man-assets>` the :ref:`Constraints <man-constraints>` and :ref:`Models <man-models>`
and :func:`optimize` the portfolios created. It simplifies this process to be very easy to create and modify portfolio optmiziations, speeding up 
the workflow of portfolio optimization.
